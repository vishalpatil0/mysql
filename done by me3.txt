1) to show the database commmands:

	a) 	SHOW DATABASES LIKE 'dbname';
	
	b)	SELECT SCHEMA_NAME
		FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA
		WHERE SCHEMA_NAME = 'DBName'
		
		Note: Above command is never used by me.
	
	c)	CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS DBName; 
	
		Note: It will also create database if its not exists.

2)	select &colname from class1 where id=&id
		
	It takes input while executing the query.

	select &&colname from class1 order by &colname desc;

	&& stores the values in define list

	SQL> define
DEFINE _DATE           = "03-NOV-20" (CHAR)
DEFINE _CONNECT_IDENTIFIER = "XE" (CHAR)
DEFINE _USER           = "SYSTEM" (CHAR)
DEFINE _PRIVILEGE      = "" (CHAR)
DEFINE _SQLPLUS_RELEASE = "1002000100" (CHAR)
DEFINE _EDITOR         = "Notepad" (CHAR)
DEFINE _O_VERSION      = "Oracle Database 10g Express Edition Release 10.2.0.1.0 - Production" (CHAR)
DEFINE _O_RELEASE      = "1002000100" (CHAR)
DEFINE COLNAME         = "name" (CHAR)
SQL> undefine colname

	define eno=121

	store the value in micro 
	by this we use it as   &eno

3) concat function takes only two input 
	that why we have to use nested concat(concat(a,b),c)	

4) flashback table tablename to before drop;
	to recover table from recycle bin

   drop table tablename purge; 
	to permanantaly delete a table

5)
	set serveroutput on
	to see the output after running plsql block
